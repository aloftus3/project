# User Manual
Our application provides a detailed insight to crimes that occur in the Hyattsville
Maryland area. Currently, the University of Maryland updates its students and staff
with crimes that occur in the area via email notifications. Our stakeholders are the 
people that live in the area but are not members of the University. We want to
inform these individuals about crimes that occur in the area so they can stay
updated and safe. 

The homepage of our system is very simple. We list the 10 most recent crimes that occured
in the area and include the crime type and date of the incident. If the user clicks on the
crime tab, they are able to filter through all of the past crimes by either crime type or 
location. For example, if you type assault in the "search table by type" field, all of the
past assaults will be listed in the table. This again includes the date of the incident, 
incident type of course which in this case would be assault, reporting area and street 
address. In addition, the user is also able to search the table by location. They can
enter a street name like Knox road for example and all of the crimes that occured on
that street would appear.

The crime types tab lists interactive links to all of the different types of crime that our
database includes. The user can click on the crime type and all crimes of that specific type would
appear in a table. For example, clicking on theft from auto would lead the user to a table that
includes all of the theft from auto crimes. Finally, our about tab provides a summary of what
our application is trying to accomplish.
